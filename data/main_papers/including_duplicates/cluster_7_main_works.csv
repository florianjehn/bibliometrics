economic resilience, security and wellbeing worldwide.The sources of these crises range from political instability and geopolitical tensions, to economic downturns, energy crises and public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.They are also confronted with structural challenges such as aging populations and managing the twin green and digital transitions, which will require deep structural changes to economies and societies.While many governments are taking advantage of the opportunities provided by rapid modernisation, in particular digitalisation, they also face a number of worrying trends, including the rise of political polarisation, the growing prevalence of dis-mis information and increasing disenchantment with traditional democratic processes.This is leading governments to increasingly focus on strengthening democratic resilience and reinforcing trust in public institutions, which is only slightly higher on average than it was following the global financial crisis. At this critical juncture, OECD member and accession countries met at the November 2022 meeting of the OECD Public Governance Committee at Ministerial Level on ""Building Trust andReinforcing Democracy"" and launched the OECD's Reinforcing Democracy Initiative (RDI).Through the RDI, countries committed to a broad set of actions to respond to some of the key governance challenges to democracy and public trust, including combatting dis/mis information; strengthening representation, participation and openness in public life; gearing up government to deliver on climate; transforming public governance for digital democracy; and embracing the global responsibilities of governments and building resilience to foreign influence.Evidence will be key to monitoring progress on these commitments.This eighth edition of Government at a Glance contributes to this evidence-base, featuring internationally comparative data on a range of public governance, tools and practices to help identify both strengths and weaknesses in democratic governance.The Focus Chapter ""Build, reinforce, protect: Democratic resilience in an age of multiple crises"" underscores three main ways that governments can work towards this goal, and was presented as a background paper to the 2023 Ministerial Council Meeting (MCM).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://openalex.org/C2778137410|https://openalex.org/C17744445|https://openalex.org/C39432304|https://openalex.org/C144133560|https://openalex.org/C138885662|https://openalex.org/C41895202,https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2732820|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q36442|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q188847|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4830453|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5891|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8162,Government (linguistics)|Political science|Environmental science|Business|Philosophy|Linguistics,2|0|0|0|0|1,0.543161|0.34697768|0.34385988|0.33437207|0.12033865|0.0,,,,,,True,https://doi.org/10.1787/3d5c5d31-en,https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/deliver/3d5c5d31-en.pdf?itemId=%2Fcontent%2Fpublication%2F3d5c5d31-en&mimeType=pdf,,,publishedVersion,True,True,https://openalex.org/S4210170024,Government at a glance,2221-4380,2221-4380|2221-4399,False,False,,https://openalex.org/P4310320232,Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,https://openalex.org/P4310320232,Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,book series,,,,,,,,2024|2023|2020,4|1|1

At this critical juncture, OECD member and accession countries met at the November 2022 meeting of the OECD Public Governance Committee at Ministerial Level on ""Building Trust andReinforcing Democracy"" and launched the OECD's Reinforcing Democracy Initiative (RDI).Through the RDI, countries committed to a broad set of actions to respond to some of the key governance challenges to democracy and public trust, including combatting dis/mis information; strengthening representation, participation and openness in public life; gearing up government to deliver on climate; transforming public governance for digital democracy; and embracing the global responsibilities of governments and building resilience to foreign influence.Evidence will be key to monitoring progress on these commitments.This eighth edition of Government at a Glance contributes to this evidence-base, featuring internationally comparative data on a range of public governance, tools and practices to help identify both strengths and weaknesses in democratic governance.The Focus Chapter ""Build, reinforce, protect: Democratic resilience in an age of multiple crises"" underscores three main ways that governments can work towards this goal, and was presented as a background paper to the 2023 Ministerial Council Meeting (MCM).",,,,,,,,,,,https://openalex.org/T11432|https://openalex.org/T12040,Gender Representation in Political Science Research|Impact of Bilateral Investment Treaties on FDI,0.7989|0.7622,https://openalex.org/subfields/3318|https://openalex.org/subfields/1408,Gender Studies|Strategy and Management,https://openalex.org/fields/33|https://openalex.org/fields/14,"Social Sciences|Business, Management and Accounting",https://openalex.org/domains/2|https://openalex.org/domains/2,Social Sciences|Social Sciences,https://openalex.org/keywords/global-governance,Global Governance,0.492016,https://openalex.org/C2992299759|https://openalex.org/C17744445|https://openalex.org/C15744967|https://openalex.org/C144024400|https://openalex.org/C107993555,https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q113453|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q36442|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9418|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q21201|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1662673,Gender equality|Political science|Psychology|Sociology|Gender studies,2|0|0|0|1,0.60950804|0.4128651|0.40060073|0.29303825|0.24015138,,,,,,True,https://doi.org/10.1787/12bf9545-en,https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/deliver/3d5c5d31-en.pdf?itemId=%2Fcontent%2Fpublication%2F3d5c5d31-en&mimeType=pdf,,,publishedVersion,True,True,https://openalex.org/S4210170024,Government at a glance,2221-4380,2221-4380|2221-4399,False,False,False,https://openalex.org/P4310320232,Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,https://openalex.org/P4310320232,Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,book series,,https://metadata.un.org/sdg/5,Gender equality,0.77,,,,,

At this critical juncture, OECD member and accession countries met at the November 2022 meeting of the OECD Public Governance Committee at Ministerial Level on ""Building Trust andReinforcing Democracy"" and launched the OECD's Reinforcing Democracy Initiative (RDI).Through the RDI, countries committed to a broad set of actions to respond to some of the key governance challenges to democracy and public trust, including combatting dis/mis information; strengthening representation, participation and openness in public life; gearing up government to deliver on climate; transforming public governance for digital democracy; and embracing the global responsibilities of governments and building resilience to foreign influence.Evidence will be key to monitoring progress on these commitments.This eighth edition of Government at a Glance contributes to this evidence-base, featuring internationally comparative data on a range of public governance, tools and practices to help identify both strengths and weaknesses in democratic governance.The Focus Chapter ""Build, reinforce, protect: Democratic resilience in an age of multiple crises"" underscores three main ways that governments can work towards this goal, and was presented as a background paper to the 2023 Ministerial Council Meeting (MCM).",,,,,,,,,,,https://openalex.org/T11770,Impact of Infrastructure and Taxation on Economic Growth,0.8707,https://openalex.org/subfields/2002,Economics and Econometrics,https://openalex.org/fields/20,"Economics, Econometrics and Finance",https://openalex.org/domains/2,Social Sciences,https://openalex.org/keywords/government-expenditure,Government Expenditure,0.455123,https://openalex.org/C2778137410|https://openalex.org/C195487862|https://openalex.org/C110121322|https://openalex.org/C193991484|https://openalex.org/C144133560|https://openalex.org/C100001284|https://openalex.org/C162324750|https://openalex.org/C10138342|https://openalex.org/C33923547|https://openalex.org/C134306372|https://openalex.org/C138885662|https://openalex.org/C41895202,https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2732820|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q850210|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q865811|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2509483|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4830453|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2248246|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8134|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q43015|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q395|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7754|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5891|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8162,Government (linguistics)|Revenue|Distribution (mathematics)|Government revenue|Business|Public economics|Economics|Finance|Mathematics|Mathematical analysis|Philosophy|Linguistics,2|2|2|3|0|1|0|1|0|1|0|1,0.7608678|0.6806071|0.6436894|0.5180885|0.3617049|0.35519084|0.2565214|0.14639753|0.120379|0.0|0.0|0.0,,,,,,True,https://doi.org/10.1787/efb480ad-en,,,,publishedVersion,True,True,https://openalex.org/S4210170024,Government at a glance,2221-4380,2221-4380|2221-4399,False,False,,https://openalex.org/P4310320232,Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,https://openalex.org/P4310320232,Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,book series,,,,,,,,,

At this critical juncture, OECD member and accession countries met at the November 2022 meeting of the OECD Public Governance Committee at Ministerial Level on ""Building Trust andReinforcing Democracy"" and launched the OECD's Reinforcing Democracy Initiative (RDI).Through the RDI, countries committed to a broad set of actions to respond to some of the key governance challenges to democracy and public trust, including combatting dis/mis information; strengthening representation, participation and openness in public life; gearing up government to deliver on climate; transforming public governance for digital democracy; and embracing the global responsibilities of governments and building resilience to foreign influence.Evidence will be key to monitoring progress on these commitments.This eighth edition of Government at a Glance contributes to this evidence-base, featuring internationally comparative data on a range of public governance, tools and practices to help identify both strengths and weaknesses in democratic governance.The Focus Chapter ""Build, reinforce, protect: Democratic resilience in an age of multiple crises"" underscores three main ways that governments can work towards this goal, and was presented as a background paper to the 2023 Ministerial Council Meeting (MCM).",,,,,,,,,,,https://openalex.org/T11432|https://openalex.org/T10443,Gender Representation in Political Science Research|Politics and Economics of Welfare State,0.9134|0.9098,https://openalex.org/subfields/3318|https://openalex.org/subfields/3320,Gender Studies|Political Science and International Relations,https://openalex.org/fields/33|https://openalex.org/fields/33,Social Sciences|Social Sciences,https://openalex.org/domains/2|https://openalex.org/domains/2,Social Sciences|Social Sciences,https://openalex.org/keywords/institutional-change,Institutional Change,0.492358,https://openalex.org/C2781440851|https://openalex.org/C2992299759|https://openalex.org/C17744445|https://openalex.org/C4249254|https://openalex.org/C107993555|https://openalex.org/C199539241|https://openalex.org/C162324750|https://openalex.org/C144024400|https://openalex.org/C94625758,https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q35749|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q113453|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q36442|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3044431|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1662673|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7748|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8134|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q21201|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7163,Parliament|Gender equality|Political science|Demographic economics|Gender studies|Law|Economics|Sociology|Politics,3|2|0|1|1|1|0|0|2,0.95122457|0.6476996|0.5460917|0.3570726|0.26668486|0.22825158|0.21489877|0.17508706|0.09879294,,,,,,True,https://doi.org/10.1787/0cd903ca-en,https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/deliver/3d5c5d31-en.pdf?itemId=%2Fcontent%2Fpublication%2F3d5c5d31-en&mimeType=pdf,,,publishedVersion,True,True,https://openalex.org/S4210170024,Government at a glance,2221-4380,2221-4380|2221-4399,False,False,,https://openalex.org/P4310320232,Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,https://openalex.org/P4310320232,Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,book series,,https://metadata.un.org/sdg/5,Gender equality,0.75,,,,,

At this critical juncture, OECD member and accession countries met at the November 2022 meeting of the OECD Public Governance Committee at Ministerial Level on ""Building Trust andReinforcing Democracy"" and launched the OECD's Reinforcing Democracy Initiative (RDI).Through the RDI, countries committed to a broad set of actions to respond to some of the key governance challenges to democracy and public trust, including combatting dis/mis information; strengthening representation, participation and openness in public life; gearing up government to deliver on climate; transforming public governance for digital democracy; and embracing the global responsibilities of governments and building resilience to foreign influence.Evidence will be key to monitoring progress on these commitments.This eighth edition of Government at a Glance contributes to this evidence-base, featuring internationally comparative data on a range of public governance, tools and practices to help identify both strengths and weaknesses in democratic governance.The Focus Chapter ""Build, reinforce, protect: Democratic resilience in an age of multiple crises"" underscores three main ways that governments can work towards this goal, and was presented as a background paper to the 2023 Ministerial Council Meeting (MCM).",,,,,,,,,,,https://openalex.org/T11807,Assessment and Enhancement of Infrastructure Resilience,0.3329,https://openalex.org/subfields/2205,Civil and Structural Engineering,https://openalex.org/fields/22,Engineering,https://openalex.org/domains/3,Physical Sciences,https://openalex.org/keywords/infrastructure-resilience,Infrastructure Resilience,0.520338,https://openalex.org/C2779585090|https://openalex.org/C144133560|https://openalex.org/C2780057273|https://openalex.org/C107826830|https://openalex.org/C132651083|https://openalex.org/C39432304|https://openalex.org/C91375879|https://openalex.org/C127313418|https://openalex.org/C111368507|https://openalex.org/C192562407|https://openalex.org/C159985019,https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3457762|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4830453|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3427027|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q929380|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7942|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q188847|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q15473274|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1069|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q43518|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q228736|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q181790,Resilience (materials science)|Business|Green infrastructure|Environmental resource management|Climate change|Environmental science|Environmental planning|Geology|Oceanography|Materials science|Composite material,2|0|2|1|2|0|1|0|1|0|1,0.560446|0.515351|0.4571793|0.41518387|0.41462338|0.38797426|0.3562227|0.14482564|0.08986181|0.058149517|0.0,,,,,,True,https://doi.org/10.1787/3eaeb502-en,https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/deliver/3d5c5d31-en.pdf?itemId=%2Fcontent%2Fpublication%2F3d5c5d31-en&mimeType=pdf,,,publishedVersion,True,True,https://openalex.org/S4210170024,Government at a glance,2221-4380,2221-4380|2221-4399,False,False,False,https://openalex.org/P4310320232,Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,https://openalex.org/P4310320232,Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,book series,,https://metadata.un.org/sdg/13,Climate action,0.57,,,,,

At this critical juncture, OECD member and accession countries met at the November 2022 meeting of the OECD Public Governance Committee at Ministerial Level on ""Building Trust andReinforcing Democracy"" and launched the OECD's Reinforcing Democracy Initiative (RDI).Through the RDI, countries committed to a broad set of actions to respond to some of the key governance challenges to democracy and public trust, including combatting dis/mis information; strengthening representation, participation and openness in public life; gearing up government to deliver on climate; transforming public governance for digital democracy; and embracing the global responsibilities of governments and building resilience to foreign influence.Evidence will be key to monitoring progress on these commitments.This eighth edition of Government at a Glance contributes to this evidence-base, featuring internationally comparative data on a range of public governance, tools and practices to help identify both strengths and weaknesses in democratic governance.The Focus Chapter ""Build, reinforce, protect: Democratic resilience in an age of multiple crises"" underscores three main ways that governments can work towards this goal, and was presented as a background paper to the 2023 Ministerial Council Meeting (MCM).",,,,,,,,,,,https://openalex.org/T12225,Impact of Political Connections on Business Strategies,0.9327,https://openalex.org/subfields/1408,Strategy and Management,https://openalex.org/fields/14,"Business, Management and Accounting",https://openalex.org/domains/2,Social Sciences,https://openalex.org/keywords/corporate-lobbying,Corporate Lobbying,0.505949,https://openalex.org/C2779530757|https://openalex.org/C41008148|https://openalex.org/C144133560|https://openalex.org/C121332964|https://openalex.org/C62520636,https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1207505|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q21198|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4830453|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q413|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q944,Quality (philosophy)|Computer science|Business|Physics|Quantum mechanics,2|0|0|0|1,0.72133255|0.46366906|0.43884602|0.046474963|0.0,,,,,,True,https://doi.org/10.1787/23d26862-en,https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/deliver/3d5c5d31-en.pdf?itemId=%2Fcontent%2Fpublication%2F3d5c5d31-en&mimeType=pdf,,,publishedVersion,True,True,https://openalex.org/S4210170024,Government at a glance,2221-4380,2221-4380|2221-4399,False,False,,https://openalex.org/P4310320232,Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,https://openalex.org/P4310320232,Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,book series,,,,,,,,,

At this critical juncture, OECD member and accession countries met at the November 2022 meeting of the OECD Public Governance Committee at Ministerial Level on ""Building Trust andReinforcing Democracy"" and launched the OECD's Reinforcing Democracy Initiative (RDI).Through the RDI, countries committed to a broad set of actions to respond to some of the key governance challenges to democracy and public trust, including combatting dis/mis information; strengthening representation, participation and openness in public life; gearing up government to deliver on climate; transforming public governance for digital democracy; and embracing the global responsibilities of governments and building resilience to foreign influence.Evidence will be key to monitoring progress on these commitments.This eighth edition of Government at a Glance contributes to this evidence-base, featuring internationally comparative data on a range of public governance, tools and practices to help identify both strengths and weaknesses in democratic governance.The Focus Chapter ""Build, reinforce, protect: Democratic resilience in an age of multiple crises"" underscores three main ways that governments can work towards this goal, and was presented as a background paper to the 2023 Ministerial Council Meeting (MCM).",,,,,,,,,,,https://openalex.org/T14490,Social and Economic Rights in Europe,0.3946,https://openalex.org/subfields/3312,Sociology and Political Science,https://openalex.org/fields/33,Social Sciences,https://openalex.org/domains/2,Social Sciences,https://openalex.org/keywords/social-rights,Social Rights,0.473391,https://openalex.org/C2778137410|https://openalex.org/C95691615|https://openalex.org/C190253527|https://openalex.org/C17744445|https://openalex.org/C144133560|https://openalex.org/C162324750|https://openalex.org/C199539241|https://openalex.org/C169437150|https://openalex.org/C138885662|https://openalex.org/C41895202,https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2732820|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3237872|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q295354|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q36442|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4830453|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8134|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7748|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8458|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5891|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8162,Government (linguistics)|Fundamental rights|Law and economics|Political science|Business|Economics|Law|Human rights|Philosophy|Linguistics,2|3|1|0|0|0|1|2|0|1,0.61527073|0.42827684|0.40701|0.36659396|0.32096052|0.22955224|0.19051376|0.1705471|0.12101635|0.0,,,,,,True,https://doi.org/10.1787/0841b81a-en,https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/deliver/3d5c5d31-en.pdf?itemId=%2Fcontent%2Fpublication%2F3d5c5d31-en&mimeType=pdf,,,publishedVersion,True,True,https://openalex.org/S4210170024,Government at a glance,2221-4380,2221-4380|2221-4399,False,False,,https://openalex.org/P4310320232,Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,https://openalex.org/P4310320232,Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,book series,,https://metadata.un.org/sdg/16,"Peace, justice, and strong institutions",0.54,,,,,

At this critical juncture, OECD member and accession countries met at the November 2022 meeting of the OECD Public Governance Committee at Ministerial Level on ""Building Trust andReinforcing Democracy"" and launched the OECD's Reinforcing Democracy Initiative (RDI).Through the RDI, countries committed to a broad set of actions to respond to some of the key governance challenges to democracy and public trust, including combatting dis/mis information; strengthening representation, participation and openness in public life; gearing up government to deliver on climate; transforming public governance for digital democracy; and embracing the global responsibilities of governments and building resilience to foreign influence.Evidence will be key to monitoring progress on these commitments.This eighth edition of Government at a Glance contributes to this evidence-base, featuring internationally comparative data on a range of public governance, tools and practices to help identify both strengths and weaknesses in democratic governance.The Focus Chapter ""Build, reinforce, protect: Democratic resilience in an age of multiple crises"" underscores three main ways that governments can work towards this goal, and was presented as a background paper to the 2023 Ministerial Council Meeting (MCM).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://openalex.org/C2778137410|https://openalex.org/C17744445|https://openalex.org/C39432304|https://openalex.org/C144133560|https://openalex.org/C138885662|https://openalex.org/C41895202,https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2732820|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q36442|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q188847|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4830453|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5891|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8162,Government (linguistics)|Political science|Environmental science|Business|Philosophy|Linguistics,2|0|0|0|0|1,0.543161|0.34697768|0.34385988|0.33437207|0.12033865|0.0,,,,,,True,https://doi.org/10.1787/3d5c5d31-en,https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/deliver/3d5c5d31-en.pdf?itemId=%2Fcontent%2Fpublication%2F3d5c5d31-en&mimeType=pdf,,,publishedVersion,True,True,https://openalex.org/S4210170024,Government at a glance,2221-4380,2221-4380|2221-4399,False,False,,https://openalex.org/P4310320232,Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,https://openalex.org/P4310320232,Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,book series,,,,,,,,2024|2023|2020,4|1|1

At this critical juncture, OECD member and accession countries met at the November 2022 meeting of the OECD Public Governance Committee at Ministerial Level on ""Building Trust andReinforcing Democracy"" and launched the OECD's Reinforcing Democracy Initiative (RDI).Through the RDI, countries committed to a broad set of actions to respond to some of the key governance challenges to democracy and public trust, including combatting dis/mis information; strengthening representation, participation and openness in public life; gearing up government to deliver on climate; transforming public governance for digital democracy; and embracing the global responsibilities of governments and building resilience to foreign influence.Evidence will be key to monitoring progress on these commitments.This eighth edition of Government at a Glance contributes to this evidence-base, featuring internationally comparative data on a range of public governance, tools and practices to help identify both strengths and weaknesses in democratic governance.The Focus Chapter ""Build, reinforce, protect: Democratic resilience in an age of multiple crises"" underscores three main ways that governments can work towards this goal, and was presented as a background paper to the 2023 Ministerial Council Meeting (MCM).",,,,,,,,,,,https://openalex.org/T12779,Role of Public Procurement in Driving Innovation and Sustainability,0.9316,https://openalex.org/subfields/1408,Strategy and Management,https://openalex.org/fields/14,"Business, Management and Accounting",https://openalex.org/domains/2,Social Sciences,https://openalex.org/keywords/green-procurement|https://openalex.org/keywords/demand-side-policies,Green Procurement|Demand-side Policies,0.535109|0.510075,https://openalex.org/C201650216|https://openalex.org/C144133560|https://openalex.org/C40700|https://openalex.org/C195094911|https://openalex.org/C162853370,https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q829492|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4830453|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1411783|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q14167904|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q39809,Procurement|Business|Industrial organization|Process management|Marketing,2|0|1|1|1,0.8158113|0.54021543|0.3480128|0.33817852|0.085360765,,,,,,True,https://doi.org/10.1787/30a1d38e-en,https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/deliver/3d5c5d31-en.pdf?itemId=%2Fcontent%2Fpublication%2F3d5c5d31-en&mimeType=pdf,,,publishedVersion,True,True,https://openalex.org/S4210170024,Government at a glance,2221-4380,2221-4380|2221-4399,False,False,,https://openalex.org/P4310320232,Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,https://openalex.org/P4310320232,Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,book series,,,,,,,,,

At this critical juncture, OECD member and accession countries met at the November 2022 meeting of the OECD Public Governance Committee at Ministerial Level on ""Building Trust andReinforcing Democracy"" and launched the OECD's Reinforcing Democracy Initiative (RDI).Through the RDI, countries committed to a broad set of actions to respond to some of the key governance challenges to democracy and public trust, including combatting dis/mis information; strengthening representation, participation and openness in public life; gearing up government to deliver on climate; transforming public governance for digital democracy; and embracing the global responsibilities of governments and building resilience to foreign influence.Evidence will be key to monitoring progress on these commitments.This eighth edition of Government at a Glance contributes to this evidence-base, featuring internationally comparative data on a range of public governance, tools and practices to help identify both strengths and weaknesses in democratic governance.The Focus Chapter ""Build, reinforce, protect: Democratic resilience in an age of multiple crises"" underscores three main ways that governments can work towards this goal, and was presented as a background paper to the 2023 Ministerial Council Meeting (MCM).",,,,,,,,,,,https://openalex.org/T11432|https://openalex.org/T12040,Gender Representation in Political Science Research|Impact of Bilateral Investment Treaties on FDI,0.7989|0.7622,https://openalex.org/subfields/3318|https://openalex.org/subfields/1408,Gender Studies|Strategy and Management,https://openalex.org/fields/33|https://openalex.org/fields/14,"Social Sciences|Business, Management and Accounting",https://openalex.org/domains/2|https://openalex.org/domains/2,Social Sciences|Social Sciences,https://openalex.org/keywords/global-governance,Global Governance,0.492016,https://openalex.org/C2992299759|https://openalex.org/C17744445|https://openalex.org/C15744967|https://openalex.org/C144024400|https://openalex.org/C107993555,https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q113453|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q36442|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9418|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q21201|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1662673,Gender equality|Political science|Psychology|Sociology|Gender studies,2|0|0|0|1,0.60950804|0.4128651|0.40060073|0.29303825|0.24015138,,,,,,True,https://doi.org/10.1787/12bf9545-en,https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/deliver/3d5c5d31-en.pdf?itemId=%2Fcontent%2Fpublication%2F3d5c5d31-en&mimeType=pdf,,,publishedVersion,True,True,https://openalex.org/S4210170024,Government at a glance,2221-4380,2221-4380|2221-4399,False,False,False,https://openalex.org/P4310320232,Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,https://openalex.org/P4310320232,Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,book series,,https://metadata.un.org/sdg/5,Gender equality,0.77,,,,,

At this critical juncture, OECD member and accession countries met at the November 2022 meeting of the OECD Public Governance Committee at Ministerial Level on ""Building Trust andReinforcing Democracy"" and launched the OECD's Reinforcing Democracy Initiative (RDI).Through the RDI, countries committed to a broad set of actions to respond to some of the key governance challenges to democracy and public trust, including combatting dis/mis information; strengthening representation, participation and openness in public life; gearing up government to deliver on climate; transforming public governance for digital democracy; and embracing the global responsibilities of governments and building resilience to foreign influence.Evidence will be key to monitoring progress on these commitments.This eighth edition of Government at a Glance contributes to this evidence-base, featuring internationally comparative data on a range of public governance, tools and practices to help identify both strengths and weaknesses in democratic governance.The Focus Chapter ""Build, reinforce, protect: Democratic resilience in an age of multiple crises"" underscores three main ways that governments can work towards this goal, and was presented as a background paper to the 2023 Ministerial Council Meeting (MCM).",,,,,,,,,,,https://openalex.org/T12755,Impact of Legal Education on Society and Professionals,0.9358,https://openalex.org/subfields/3308,Law,https://openalex.org/fields/33,Social Sciences,https://openalex.org/domains/2,Social Sciences,https://openalex.org/keywords/civil-justice-problems,Civil Justice Problems,0.415618,https://openalex.org/C139621336|https://openalex.org/C17744445|https://openalex.org/C190253527|https://openalex.org/C41008148|https://openalex.org/C162324750|https://openalex.org/C199539241,https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3190382|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q36442|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q295354|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q21198|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8134|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7748,Economic Justice|Political science|Law and economics|Computer science|Economics|Law,2|0|1|0|0|1,0.60946834|0.43243107|0.37484455|0.35724205|0.32914233|0.16526148,,,,,,True,https://doi.org/10.1787/20255a5a-en,https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/deliver/3d5c5d31-en.pdf?itemId=%2Fcontent%2Fpublication%2F3d5c5d31-en&mimeType=pdf,,,publishedVersion,True,True,https://openalex.org/S4210170024,Government at a glance,2221-4380,2221-4380|2221-4399,False,False,,https://openalex.org/P4310320232,Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,https://openalex.org/P4310320232,Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,book series,,https://metadata.un.org/sdg/16,"Peace, justice, and strong institutions",0.45,,,,,

economic resilience, security and wellbeing worldwide.The sources of these crises range from political instability and geopolitical tensions, to economic downturns, energy crises and public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.They are also confronted with structural challenges such as aging populations and managing the twin green and digital transitions, which will require deep structural changes to economies and societies.While many governments are taking advantage of the opportunities provided by rapid modernisation, in particular digitalisation, they also face a number of

governments to increasingly focus on strengthening democratic resilience and reinforcing trust in public institutions, which is only slightly higher on average than it was following the global financial crisis. At this critical juncture, OECD member and accession countries met at the November 2022 meeting of the OECD Public Governance Committee at Ministerial Level on ""Building Trust andReinforcing Democracy"" and launched the OECD's Reinforcing Democracy Initiative (RDI).Through the RDI, countries committed to a broad set of actions to respond to some of the key governance challenges to democracy and public trust, including combatting dis/mis information; strengthening representation, participation and openness in public life; gearing up government to deliver on climate; transforming public governance for digital democracy; and embracing the global responsibilities of governments and building resilience to foreign influence.Evidence will be key to monitoring progress on these commitments.This eighth edition of Government at a Glance contributes to this evidence-base, featuring internationally comparative data on a range of public governance, tools and practices to help identify both strengths and weaknesses in democratic governance.The Focus Chapter ""Build, reinforce, protect: Democratic resilience in an age of multiple crises"" underscores three main ways that governments can work towards this goal, and was presented as a background paper to the 2023 Ministerial Council Meeting (MCM).",,,,,,,,,,,https://openalex.org/T12667,Socio-Economic Development and Global Economic Challenges,0.2527,https://openalex.org/subfields/3303,Development,https://openalex.org/fields/33,Social Sciences,https://openalex.org/domains/2,Social Sciences,,,,https://openalex.org/C2778348673|https://openalex.org/C162324750|https://openalex.org/C175444787,https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q739302|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8134|https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q39072,Production (economics)|Economics|Microeconomics,2|0|1,0.5905553|0.12865275|0.042539597,,,,,,True,https://doi.org/10.1787/39fed1bf-en,https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/deliver/3d5c5d31-en.pdf?itemId=%2Fcontent%2Fpublication%2F3d5c5d31-en&mimeType=pdf,,,publishedVersion,True,True,https://openalex.org/S4210170024,Government at a glance,2221-4380,2221-4380|2221-4399,False,False,,https://openalex.org/P4310320232,Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,https://openalex.org/P4310320232,Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,book series,,,,,,,,,
